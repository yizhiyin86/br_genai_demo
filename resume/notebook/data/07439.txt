Business Intelligence Developer Business Intelligence Developer Business Intelligence Developer - Cerner Corporation Work Experience Business Intelligence Developer Cerner Corporation - Kansas City, KS October 2015 to Present Kansas  February 2019 - Present    * Maintain the infrastructure capacity management teams suite of data sets and reports  * Built and maintain a virtual machine capacity dashboard to forecast needs out to 18 months in the future.  * I built a requisition name generator for compute purchases in Python and using Jenkins to run the script daily then write it to a PostgreSQL table. This saves an average of five minutes per requisition which accounts for an average savings of 25 hours of month as well as improved accuracy.  * Assisted in data collection and visualization for a capacity on demand model as a proof of concept to buy capacity ahead of the demand. This was accomplished by aggregating the server requests by month then mapping these requests to the configuration that supports the intended usage. Power BI was leveraged for the visualization of this data and the end user has the ability to select the date range for the average demand but the default is set at six months.
