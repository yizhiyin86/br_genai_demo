Having a solid line of communication with my developers  was extremely beneficial to navigating each build process  • 400 seat speaking arrangements    Notable Projects:  The Tavern League of Wisconsin (TLW) mobile application build has a large project scope containing both a front end mobile app solution on two platforms (iOS & Android) and a back end server side  database solution that must communicate logic back and forth to then be stored on each platform  database. The TLW is a large non-profit organization that has around 5,000 members and 2,500 affiliate  members of small business owners all across the state of Wisconsin.    The primary objectives were to provide solutions for the following challenges of the Tavern League:    • Give the executives and members of the league a digital map to find all of their fellow members across the state of Wisconsin  • Use it as a recruiting tool for businesses that are not currently members    The University Ridge Golf Course mobile application was built to help provide an opportunity for golfers to book a tee time from the app, keep score, have a virtual caddie for yardage on the course, book swing  lessons, and help to increase sales revenue within the restaurant located on premise.
