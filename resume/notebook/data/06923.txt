I worked closely with young adults and late adults alike, and maintained close relationships with my clients' caseworkers, community advocates, and medical professionals such as psychiatrists, primary care providers, and specialists.

I also successfully worked with computers and other technology, running diagnostics and repairs for both hardware and software, performing virus removal, program setup, computer and printer hardware setup, and providing educational services to clients who wished to better understand their technologies. Standing Down project coordinator Kentucky Humanities Council September 2014 to December 2014 James Haggie organized and moderated a support group for veterans in Lexington that received funding from the Kentucky Humanities Council as part of a flagship research project being conducted by New York University. The aim of the group was to connect younger veterans with older ones, to share experiences, to build comraderies, to help stimulate the healing process in younger veterans by allowing older veterans to share their own healing processes, and fostering an environment where veterans can open up and share their struggles returning to civilian life. The project was an overwhelming success, and a large amount of data was collected, returned to NYU for analysis, and talks are in the work of implementing a more long-term commitment towards the group in Lexington.
