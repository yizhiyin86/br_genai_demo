All incoming transactions from the RedNet are examined by the FireBreak to determine if they violate any of a plurality of protection rules stored in a local protection rules database. Any transaction found to be in violation is discarded. Valid transactions are forwarded to the BlackNet. If an otherwise valid transaction is found to be suspicious, the FireBreak will forward to a FireNet Server relevant information relating to that transaction. If the FireNet Server verifies that the transaction is indeed part of an attack, the FireNet Server will create new protection rules suitable to defend against the newly identified source or strategy of attack. Periodically, all FireBreaks in the FireNet system will transfer, directly or indirectly, all new rules.
