Founder/Full Stack Developer Founder/Full Stack <span class="hl">Developer</span> Software Engineer/Frontend Engineer/Backend Engineer/Fullstack Engineer/Java/Javascript/Web Developer San Francisco Bay Area, CA My love of programming began with an introduction to the first-generation Pentium computers in my high school; it was love at first sight. Over the years, I honed my programming skills and gained knowledge of multiparadigm languages such as Java, C++, Javascript, Python, and Ruby, procedural languages such as C, a logic programming language such as PROLOG, and database languages such as MySQL, SQL, and MongoDB.     I would describe myself as a self-starter, versatile, determined, and someone who is learning from my mistakes. I am creative, open-minded, and easy-going. I enjoy working in a team. I love solving engineering problems to make things happen.     To gain experience, I created my website forexkarma.com and ratnalama.com, and a business website for a restaurant from scratch. Most notably, I built forexkarma.com from the ground up and created over eighty unique search engine optimized (SEO) web pages to drive traffic organically from 0 to 50K/month at its peak.     Most recently, in my senior year at the university, I led a team of five fellow members to develop a craigslist listing-esque full web application using the best practices of modern software engineering processes such as scrum/agile and user-centered design for good user experience. My team and I used HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap in the Frontend and Javascript, MySQL, NodeJS Express, AWS server in the backend to develop the web-app which is live for demo purposes here: bit.ly/oasislisting    Having completed numerous projects as a Computer Science major, I am getting better and better as a programmer. I expect to grow my software engineering skills exponentially as I learn and develop my career as a software developer. I feel confident that I will be a valuable asset to any engineering team.    I'm incredibly excited to have the opportunity to be considered for Web Developer/Frontend Engineer/Backend Engineer/Fullstack Engineer position.    Thank you for taking the time to read my note.    Best,  Ratna Lama  https://ratnalama.com/ Work Experience Founder/Full Stack Developer forexkarma.com - San Francisco, CA 2010 to Present • Built forexkarama.com with over 80 unique web page contents to serve and support retail   trading community  • Created SEO pages to drive traffic organically from 0 to 50K/month  • Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Bootsrap, Javascript, AWS, MySQL, Git Front End Developer littlenepalsf.com - San Francisco, CA April 2017 to April 2019 • Built Littlenepalsf.com from the ground-up with search engine optimized ?SEO? pages to grow  the site traffic organically by 30%  • Integrated third party web app to facilitate ecommerce  capability  • Designed, developed, tested, deployed, and  maintained the web app in the AWS cloud  • Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Bootsrap, Javascript, AWS, MySQL, Git Education Bachelor of Science in B.Sc.
