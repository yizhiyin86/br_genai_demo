My first job with the company was Long Distance Operator located in Birmingham Alabama. I was 18 years old and most of my co- workers were also 18-25. Yes I was the voice tat answered when "0" was dialed on the phone. The job required a lot if multitaskin and manual record keeping to connect callers correctly, billing, and emergency situation calls all while keeping the customer happy and meet call volume requirements. BellSouth went thru a lot of changes from 1969 and 2003 and I did also. The education from company training and tution reimbursement gave me a million dollar education with no student loan.  I became disabled in April 2003 or I am sure I would still be working and I think it would now be AT&T or HP. I miss the customer interaction and the day to day planning, implementing, training and the challenge. I enjoyed working on many projects as the computer world/ technology evolved. I worked on Disaster Recovery, Processes and Procedure, and Program Requirements.
