IT Program Manager <span class="hl">IT</span> Program <span class="hl">Manager</span> IT Program Manager - Umpqua Bank Maple Valley, WA Managing Change – Distilling Complexity – Delivering Value  My focus has always been on delivering value. I enjoy wrapping my head  around the technical solution parameters and the business domain to ensure  the initiative leads directly to strategic goals. In my experience, I often find  the real work lies at the intersections. It’s where raw data is turned into  actionable analysis. It’s how the interface is configured to afford optimal  ease-of-use and ideal functionality. It’s where strategy, marketing, business  owners, architects, developers, vendors and more come together to release a  compelling new product. At the intersections is where I operate.
