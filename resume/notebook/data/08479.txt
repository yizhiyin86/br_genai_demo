I am an expert at keeping project costs down and ensuring the highest level of performance management in business operations.    For the last five years I have been employed as a consultant with multiple organizations. My taking short term contracts in different fields has been purposeful so that I could gain different perspectives of how PMO’s and experts in the field handles projects. I am now seeking to put what I have learned into action and find a long-term career role.    I play an active role in the day to day management, direction and co-ordination of projects. I primarily help teams and clients to adopt best practices from the Agile Framework, and because of this have a high level of interaction with external and internal clients and report directly to the executive levels of the organization.    On a personal level I have the gravitas and dynamism needed to get the best out of others and to get things done on time and within budget.    I hope that after reviewing my attached resume you will be convinced of my potential and invite me for an interview to discuss my application in further detail. If required I can provide you with excellent references from my current and previous employers.    Yours sincerely,    Michael Perkins
