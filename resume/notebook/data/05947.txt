Front End Developer <span class="hl">Front</span> <span class="hl">End</span> <span class="hl">Developer</span> Orange County, CA, US I'm a web developer with over 15 years of experience in Fashion Design/Management. As a former designer, I produced sketches which were used as a blue print to manufacture clothing in accordance to my clients' wishes. I collaborated with various departments including the production team, various fabric vendors, and sewers in order to maintain quality assurance throughout the production process. Despite encountering many challenges, I promote working as a team with everyone involved, in order to generate solutions and develop a final product that people would be proud to wear.     When web developing, I utilize the same approach used during my prior career as a fashion designer. My goal is to promote a team environment that is conducive to problem solving. During the development process, I hope that I can encourage and inspire my colleagues to develop a flawless product.
