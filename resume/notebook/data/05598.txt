Freelance Web Developer Freelance Web <span class="hl">Developer</span> Front- end Developer Ladera Ranch, CA For the last couple of years I have been working with a wide variety of clients with different needs: from redesigning WordPress and other CMS theme to creating new complicated designs with responsive layout. Combining all my skills in HTML (HTML5), CSS (CSS3), Bootstrap, jQuery, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, and other knowledge I do my best to create web sites which meet all customer requirements.    I have been a part of a team which works on 2 or more projects at the same time, and this opportunity gave me a chance to learn git (source code management system). I am viewed as organized, great at multitasking, I always meet deadlines, and pay attention to details.    At the same time I work on my own projects. This has helped me face and overcome a variety of challenges as well as hone my professional skills.
